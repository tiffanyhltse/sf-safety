For our final project of BSDS_200 at the University of San Francisco, our group was interested in ultimately predicting crime that occurs in San Francisco. Using data from the top ten most frequent crimes, along with mulitple linear regression and multi-class classification models, we were able to predict what type of crime will most likely occur in a certain district, taking into account time of day, day of week, average income, residential/downtown, etc.
